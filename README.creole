=== Description ===
A plugin that provides a Java code completion view inside of Sublime Text 2. It also provides import insertion/completion and goto source/javadocs.

=== Known issues and feature requests ===
Please go [[https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open|here]] to see the currently known issues and feature request, or to file a new.

=== Prerequisites ===
  # You need to have java installed on your system and the java binary in your path

=== Installation ===
    * The easiest way to install SublimeJava is via the excellent Package Control Plugin
    ** See http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control#Installation
    *** Once package control has been installed, bring up the command palette (cmd+shift+P or ctrl+shift+P)
    *** Type Install and select "Package Control: Install Package"
    *** Select SublimeJava from the list. Package Control will keep it automatically updated for you
    * If you want to manually install it using git instead:
    ** Go to your packages directory and type:
    ***        git clone --recursive https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava SublimeJava
    ** To update to the latest commit, use this command in the SublimeJava directory:
    ***        git pull && git submodule foreach --recursive git pull origin master
    * You most likely want to configure the "sublimejava_classpath" setting to your own, issue [[https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava/issues/23|23]] details how this is done.
    * Also, you would mostly likely want to configure the "sublimejava_sourcepath" and "sublimejava_docpath"
    to use source and doc search. NOTE: At present, this does not handle jar files.

=== Usage ===
Once installed it'll try to provide reasonable completion suggestions when you trigger autocompletion. Please note that it accomplishes this with the use of [[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html|reflection]] so it can only complete compiled classes that are in your classpath.

To import a class, type the class name wherever it is that you will be using it. Then, with the cursor on class name, 
run the "Java: Import Class Under Cursor" command.  If the class is found in the classpath, the possible imports will 
be presented to you in a quicklist. You can then choose the correct match for your import, and it will be inserted 
after the final import statement, or, if no imports are found, after the package declaration.  If none of the presented 
classes are the class that you wanted to import, check your "sublime_classpath" setting.

To go to source or javadocs, you may either look for the source under the cursor (using the "Java: Open Source/Javadoc Under Cursor" command, or simply open up a quicklist and filter through all sources ("Java: Open Source/Javadoc" command).
